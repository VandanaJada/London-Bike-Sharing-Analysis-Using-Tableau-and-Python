# **London Bike Sharing Analysis**

### **Overview**
This project analyzes the London bike-sharing dataset to uncover trends and insights using Python for data processing and Tableau for data visualization. The focus is on understanding bike usage patterns and their relationship with weather conditions.

---

### **Dataset**
- **Source**: [London Bike Sharing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset)
- The dataset includes daily records of bike-sharing usage and weather data like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

---

### **Objectives**
1. Clean and preprocess the dataset using Python.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns.
3. Visualize trends and relationships using Tableau dashboards.
4. Analyze the effect of weather on bike-sharing usage.

---

### **Key Insights**
1. **Usage Trends**:
   - Peak usage during moderate weather.
   - Significant decline in extreme weather conditions.
2. **Weather Dependency**:
   - Usage increases with favorable temperatures but decreases with high wind speeds.
3. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Enables timeline filtering and moving average adjustments.

### **Tools Used**
1. **Python**:
   - Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `datetime`.
   - Tasks: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and aggregation.
2. **Tableau**:
   - Created interactive dashboards for better data visualization.

### **Tableau Dashboard**
The dashboard visualizes:
- Total bike rides.
- A 14-day moving average of bike usage.
- A heatmap showing the relationship between temperature, wind speed, and bike usage.
